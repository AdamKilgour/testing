//About us//

Noah’s Ark @CRBC (Cairns Road Baptist Church) is responsible for Noah’s Ark Preschool and a variety of family support groups which serve children and families in Westbury Park and the surrounding area.   Our inclusive preschool provides a well resourced and nurturing learning environment for children aged 2-5years. This is enhanced by a team of highly qualified and experienced staff who work together to deliver a well planned curriculum which allows children to explore, learn and develop from the starting point of their individual interests and experiences.

Each child has a Key Person who works to develop a warm relationship with them and their family. This helps the child to develop a sense of belonging and gives the confidence to explore, learn and develop.  Children are free to move independently between our indoor and outdoor learning environments and are supported by skilled adults who resource the environment to enhance and extend learning opportunities.

Noah’s Ark has developed over almost 30 years as an expression of support for young families in our locality by Cairns Road Baptist Church. For more information about the church and its activities please click here.
